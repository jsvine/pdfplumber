- Tweak the output of `.to_json(...)` so that, if an object type is not present for a given page, it has no key in the page's object representation. ([9587cc7](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber/commit/9587cc7d2292a1eae7a0150ab406f9365944266f))

### Removed

- Remove `utils.filter_objects(...)` and move the functionality to within the `FilteredPage.objects` property calculation, the only part of the library that used it. ([9587cc7](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber/commit/9587cc7d2292a1eae7a0150ab406f9365944266f))
- Remove code that sets `pdfminer.pdftypes.STRICT = True` and `pdfminer.pdfinterp.STRICT = True`, since that [has now been the default for a while](https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six/commit/9439a3a31a347836aad1c1226168156125d9505f). ([9587cc7](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber/commit/9587cc7d2292a1eae7a0150ab406f9365944266f))

## [0.6.1] - 2022-04-23

### Changed
- Bump pinned `pdfminer.six` version to `20220319`. ([e434ed0](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber/commit/e434ed0b196f1f2c0b7f76e8ea2663e40c99e93c))

- Drop support for Python 3.6 (EOL Dec. 2021) ([a32473e](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber/commit/a32473ee5f9113d5c5a96b30270cafc58d170f46))

### Fixed
- If `pdfplumber.open(...)` opens a file but a `pdfminer.pdfparser.PSException` is raised during the process, `pdfplumber` now makes sure to close that file. ([#581](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber/pull/581) + ([#578](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber/issues/578)) [h/t @johnhuge]
- Fix incompatibility with `Pillow>=9.1`. ([#637](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber/issues/637))

## [0.6.0] - 2021-12-21
### Added
- Add `.extract_text(layout=True)`, an *experimental feature* which attempts to mimic the structural layout of the text on the page. ([#10](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber/issues/10))
- Add `utils.merge_bboxes(bboxes)`, which returns the smallest bounding box that contains all bounding boxes in the `bboxes` argument. ([f8d5e70](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber/commit/f8d5e70a509aa9ed3ee565d7d3f97bb5ec67f5a5))

- Add `join_x_tolerance` and `join_y_tolerance` to table extraction settings. ([cbb34ce](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber/commit/cbb34ce28b9b66d8d709304bbd0de267d82d75f3))

### Changed
- Upgrade `pdfminer.six` from `20200517` to `20211012`; see [that library's changelog](https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md) for details, but a key difference is an improvement in how it assigns `line`, `rect`, and `curve` objects. (Diagonal two-point lines, for instance, are now `line` objects instead of `curve` objects.) ([#515](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber/pull/515))
- Remove Decimal-ization of parsed object attributes, which are now represented with as much precision as is returned by `pdfminer.six` ([#346](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber/discussions/346) + [#520](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber/pull/520))
- `.extract_text(...)` returns `""` instead of `None` when character list is empty. ([#482](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber/issues/482) + [cb9900b](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber/commit/cb9900b49706e96df520dbd1067c2a57a4cdb20d)) [h/t @tungph]
- `.extract_words(...)` now includes `doctop` among the attributes it returns for each word. ([66fef89](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber/commit/66fef89b670cf95d13a5e23040c7bf9339944c01))
- Change behavior of horizontal `text_strategy`, so that it uses the top and bottom of *every* word, not just the top of every word and the bottom of the last. ([#467](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber/pull/467) + [#466](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber/issues/466) + [#265](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber/issues/265)) [h/t @bobluda + @samkit-jain]
- Change `table.merge_edges(...)` behavior when `join_tolerance` (and `x`/`y` variants) `<= 0`, so that joining is attempted regardless, to handle cases of overlapping lines. ([cbb34ce](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber/commit/cbb34ce28b9b66d8d709304bbd0de267d82d75f3))
- Raise error if certain table-extraction settings are negative. ([aa2d594](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber/commit/aa2d594d3b3352dbcef503e4df2e045d69fc2511))

### Fixed

- Handle `UnicodeDecodeError` when trying to decode utf-16-encoded annotations ([#463](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber/issues/463)) [h/t @tungph]
- Fix crash when extracting tables with null values in `(text|intersection)_(x|y)_tolerance` settings. ([#539](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber/discussions/539)) [h/t @yoavxyoav]

### Removed
- Remove `pdfplumber.load(...)` method, which has been deprecated since `0.5.23` ([54cbbc5](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber/commit/54cbbc5321b42f3976b2ac750c25b7b2ec6045d7))

- Fix issue raised in PR [#77](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber/pull/77) (PDFObjRef resolution), and general class of problems
- Fix issue [#90](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber/issues/90), and general class of problems, by explicitly typecasting each kind of PDF Object

## [0.5.10] — 2018-08-03
### Fixed
- Fix bug in which, when calling get_page_image(...), the alpha channel could make the whole page black out.

## [0.5.9] — 2018-07-10
### Fixed
- Fix issue [#67](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber/issues/67), in which bool-type metadata were handled incorrectly

## [0.5.8] — 2018-03-06
### Fixed
- Fix issue [#53](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber/issues/53), in which non-decimalize-able (non_)stroking_color properties were raising errors.

## [0.5.7] — 2018-01-20
### Added
- `.travis.yml`, but failing on `.to_image()`

### Changed
- Move from defunct `pycrypto` to `pycryptodome`
- Update `pdfminer.six` to `20170720`

## [0.5.6] — 2017-11-21
### Fixed
- Fix issue [#41](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber/issues/41), in which PDF-object-referenced cropboxes/mediaboxes weren't being fully resolved.

## [0.5.5] — 2017-05-10
### Added
- Access to `__version__` from main namespace

### Fixed
- Fix issue #33, by checking `decode_text`'s argument type

## [0.5.4] — 2017-04-27
### Fixed
- Pin `pdfminer.six` to version `20151013` (for now), fixing incompatibility

## [0.5.3] — 2017-02-27
### Fixed
- Allow `import pdfplumber` even if ImageMagick not installed.

## [0.5.2] — 2017-02-27
### Added
- Access to `curve` points. (E.g., `page.curves[0]["points"]`.)
- Ability for `.draw_line` to draw `curve` points.

### Changed
- Disaggregated "min_words_vertical" (default: 3) and "min_words_horizontal" (default: 1), removing "text_word_threshold".
- Internally, made `utils.decimalize` a bit more robust; now throws errors on non-decimalizable items.
- Now explicitly ignoring some (obscure) `pdfminer` object attributes.
- Raw input for `.draw_line` from a bounding box to `((x, y), (x, y))`, for consistency with `curve["points"]` and with `Pillow`'s underlying method.

### Fixed
- Fixed typo bug when `.rect_edges` is called before `.edges`

## [0.5.1] — 2017-02-26
### Added
- Quick-draw `PageImage` methods: `.draw_vline`, `.draw_vlines`, `.draw_hline`, and `.draw_hlines`.
- Boolean parameter `keep_blank_chars` for `.extract_words(...)` and `TableFinder` settings.

### Changed
- Increased default `text_tolerance` and `intersection_tolerance` TableFinder values from 1 to 3.

### Fixed
- Properly handle conversion of PDFs with transparency to `pillow` images.
- Properly handle `pandas` DataFrames as inputs to multi-draw commands (e.g., `PageImage.draw_rects(...)`).

## [0.5.0] - 2017-02-25
### Added
- Visual debugging features, via `Page.to_image(...)` and `PageImage`. (Introduces `wand` and `pillow` as package requirements.)
- More powerful options for extracting data from tables. See changes below.

### Changed
- Entirely overhaul the table-extraction methods. Now based on [Anssi Nurminen's master's thesis](http://dspace.cc.tut.fi/dpub/bitstream/handle/123456789/21520/Nurminen.pdf?sequence=3).
- Disentangle `.crop` from `.intersects_bbox` and `.within_bbox`.
- Change default `x_tolerance` and `y_tolerance` for word extraction from `5` to `3`

### Fixed
- Fix bug stemming from non-decimalized page heights. [h/t @jsfenfen]

## [0.4.6] - 2017-01-26
### Added
- Provide access to `Page.page_number`

### Changed
- Use `.page_number` instead of `.page_id` as primary identifier. [h/t @jsfenfen]
- Change default `x_tolerance` and `y_tolerance` for word extraction from `0` to `5`

### Fixed
- Provide proper support for rotated pages

## [0.4.5] - 2016-12-09
### Fixed
- Fix bug stemming from when metadata includes a PostScript literal. [h/t @boblannon]


## [0.4.4] - Mistakenly skipped

Whoops.

## [0.4.3] - 2016-04-12
### Changed
- When extracting table cells, use chars' midpoints instead of top-points.

### Fixed
- Fix find_gutters — should ignore `" "` chars
